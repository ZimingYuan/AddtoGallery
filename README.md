![Icon](./AddtoGallery.svg)



An android app to add media files from your file storage to your system gallery. Using [this](https://github.com/TutorialsAndroid/FilePicker) as file picker.

### Usage

Press the button "Choose Files". Then the file picker will pop up. Just choose the media files, and press "Ok". Wait for the prompt "Adding successfully", and those files will show up in your system gallery.

### Notice

The app will only add jpg/jpeg, png, gif, bmp, mp4 and avi files to the gallery. Other files you choose will be ignored. If you choose folders, all the files of types above inside the folders (not including the files in children folders, in other words, not recursive) will be added to the gallery.
